                        <br> Have you ever been watching a movie/show with your parents or family and a scene comes up that makes everyone
                        uncomfortable? Next time, make sure to check out Warning Watchers first! Warning Watchers is a site that provides
                        to you warnings of specific content that might not ever be mentioned in official movie ratings. 
                        <br><br> Our company aims to create a user-managed (but admin-monitored) website that allows users to submit a piece
                        of media (movie, show, book, etc.) into a database along with categories of content warnings (animal death, strong
                        language, etc.). Users (both guests and members) of the site can either search by ‘Title’ of the media or by
                        the Content Category which consist of a variety of warnings. Users are welcome to view the site but no actions on
                        posts and such cannot take place until they register with the website.
